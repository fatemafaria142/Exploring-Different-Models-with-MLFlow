MLflow is an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.

## Components:

1. **Tracking:** Allows you to track experiments to record and compare parameters and results.
2. **Models:** Manage and deploy models from various ML libraries to different serving platforms.
3. **Projects:** Package ML code in a reusable, reproducible form for sharing and production.
4. **Model Registry:** Centralize model storage, versioning, and transitions across lifecycle stages.
5. **Model Serving:** Host MLflow models as REST endpoints for easy deployment and query.
